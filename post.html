                                The problem
                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                Email marketers were limited by the functionality of the current segment builder tool.
                                They
                                wanted to be able to send more meaningful and targeted emails to specific groups of
                                people,
                                rather than sending generic emails to their entire subscriber list. The new segment
                                builder
                                tool
                                needed to empower email marketers to segment their subscribers based on rules that they
                                could
                                define. That would allow them to send more targeted email campaigns which would decrease
                                costs
                                and increase conversions.
                            </p>

                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                Over the years we’ve been collecting feedback from customers regarding how they’d like
                                to be
                                able to organise their subscribers into segments. We sorted through customer feedback to
                                figure
                                out the requirements for the new segment builder. There were a lot of different feature
                                requests
                                and it would take forever to get them all built, so we listed out the main features,
                                prioritised
                                them and concentrated on the ones that would make the most impact.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During this requirements-gathering phase we also looked at competitor products and
                                realised
                                that
                                our differentiator would be to concentrate on simplicity of use, cutting back on
                                unnecessary
                                features and complexity.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The key ingredient to creating segments is defining the rules that govern them. If we
                                wanted
                                to
                                create a segment of people who work as designers and developers in Sydney, we would need
                                a
                                way
                                to define a set of rules that captured those people. After much deliberation we decided
                                that
                                “OR” and “AND” logical operators would give us the complexity we needed to create such
                                rules
                                (above). Each rule could be based on the name, email address, date subscribed, location
                                or
                                custom field of the person.
                            </p>

                                Wireframes and sketches
                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                Once we had planned out what we were going to build, the development team was able to
                                start
                                rebuilding the back-end for speed and stability. I started on the interface design in
                                parallel
                                with them to save time, and quickly sketched out some ideas on how this page would
                                function.
                                My
                                focus was on creating maximal power with minimal UI. The page (above right) would
                                basically
                                consist of a rule builder at the top followed by a results table of the people in the
                                segment.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After exploring a bunch of ideas for the rule builder (above left), I ended up stripping
                                it
                                back
                                to a simple list of rules. Rules connected by an “OR” operator were grouped together and
                                these
                                “OR” groups could be connected with an “AND” operator. I tried to structure rules so
                                that
                                they
                                maintained a simple sentence structure, avoiding the use of cryptic “robot talk”.

                            I eat and breathe the web. I never feel more creative while designing an interface. And I
                            never feel more powerful while developing a web app. I feel lucky to be doing something that
                            I love so much.

                        <p>
                            I'm always open to new projects, challenges, and collaborations. Hit me with questions,
                            invitations, or just a simple hi.
                        </p>

                            No faking it till making it, let be ourselves as we are.
